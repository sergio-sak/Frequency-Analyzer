## Frequency Analyzer üìä
This is a project developed by [Sergio Sakellaropoulos] for analyzing the frequency of words in a text. The project uses C++ to read input either from a file or through the terminal and then calculates and displays the frequency of each word in the text.

## üöÄ Project Overview
The Frequency Analyzer project is designed to analyze the frequency of words in a given text. It provides the following features:

Reading input from a file or through the terminal.
Calculating and displaying the frequency of each word, taking punctuation and capitalization into account.
Sorting the words based on frequency and lexicographic order.

## üí° Usage

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/[sergio-sak]/FrequencyAnalyzer.git

Compile the program:
g++ -o freqanalyze freqanalyze.cpp

Run the program:
./freqanalyze
Follow the on-screen instructions to input the text and choose the input mode.

## ü§ù Collaboration
I am open to collaborating with others who are interested in extending this project. One exciting idea for collaboration is to create an all-time leaderboard of each word that the frequency analyzer has worked with.
